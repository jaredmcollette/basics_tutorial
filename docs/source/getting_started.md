# Getting started

## Buliding OpenCMISS-Iron

See [installation documentation](http://opencmiss.org/documentation/building/cmake/setup/docs/index.html/).

## Running OpenCMISS-Iron python examples

Examples in the [OpenCMISS-examples repository](https://github.com/OpenCMISS-Examples/)  can be run by first navigating to the src/python directory of the example of interest in a terminal. The example's python script can then be directly with python as shown below for the [laplace_equation example](https://github.com/OpenCMISS-Examples/laplace_equation) :

```bash
cd src/python
python laplace_equation.py
```

The next section shows how an OpenCMISS-Iron problem can be setup from scratch in python.
